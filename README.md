# laravel7-cartography
This small project allows you to create an address book with a visualization on an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map.

## Installation
After selecting a folder, please activate the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/papposilene/laravel-cartography.git
```

After cloning, several operations should be automatically performed. But, you can launch them yourself with the commands below:
```shell
composer install
npm install
```

## Customization
Laravel creates an .env file in the folder at the root of the project.
- You can enclose the name of your card in the "APP_NAME" variable in quotation marks.
- In the same file, you can choose your language. Translations are planned for English and French. You can add your language (see the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/localization)).
